# Real-Time Malware Detection Software

## Project Overview
This repository manages the source code of Software Lab Project aimed at detecting security threats to the system at runtime.

## Procedure

1. **System State Monitoring**
   - Utilize Linux kernel metadata to assess the current state of system resources.

2. **Abnormal Behavior Detection**
   - Periodically monitor for abnormal behaviors exhibited by system processes.

3. **Malicious Process Identification**
   - Detect processes that show signs of abnormal behavior.
   - Check if these processes are malicious.
   - Provide users with a list of identified malicious processes.

4. **Real-Time Resource Utilization**
   - Generate real-time plots of system resource utilization.
   - Monitor key metrics to visualize system performance and detect anomalies.

## Features
- Real-time monitoring of system resources.
- Detection and analysis of potentially malicious processes.
- User notification of identified malicious processes.
- Visual representation of system metrics for better insight.
